# Stock Price Prediction
Combination of regression models to predict stock prices for companies in a portfolio

- Extract stock prices of all companies over 20 years from Yahoo Finance and maintain a database of stock details in MySQL Server
- Test a combination of models including ARIMA Time Series, Regression Machine Learning models (KNN, Linear Regression, Ridge, LASSO, Support Vector Machines (SVM - linear, poly, rbf)), Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Pasting, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting) and Deep Learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict stock prices of the companies in the portfolio
- Web scrape real-time stock prices of all companies
- Create Tableau dashboards [here](https://tabsoft.co/2DxdiBV) for all companies' stock prices for data analysis and visualization 
- Automate the modeling process and deploy the chosen model into production in Azure ML [here](https://bit.ly/3ksg24c) using R scripts
